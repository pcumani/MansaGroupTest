## Introduction

At Mansa, we are on a mission to make the life of freelancers easier, by
reducing the time they spend on administrative tasks and providing them the
financial support they deserve. We strive to offer to this underserved
population loans that are easily accessible, with lower interest rates and
longer terms. To achieve this, we are developing a platform that involves
the entire product chain and we aim to become leader in credit services in
Europe.

To face this challenge, we need people who believe in the impact of our
business on a country's economy, and who have ideas to improve people's daily
lives. More than that, we are looking for teammates who are not satisfied
with the obvious, who get involved without being afraid of making mistakes,
and who are eager to learn and inspire others.

We provide you **3 different tests**:

- **[Backend Engineer](backend)**
- **[Frontend Engineer](frontend)**
- **[Data Scientist](datascience)**

A fourth test for **Infrastructure Engineer** is being created.

You'll learn more about the tasks we ask you to solve in their respective
`README.md` files.

Good luck! ðŸ’¥

## Delivery

For each test, we provide you a starter project to work on. This way, you'll
avoid the hassle to setup one yourself. Start within a minute by clicking
the `Use this template` button above this README. You'll be asked to create
either a public or private repository.

> Please note that after submission, if you repository is private, we
> may ask you to add several people to it to ease the review
> process.

<details>
<summary>You do not want to add us to your repository?</summary>

Git can create a standalone bundle of your repository containing all the
commit history:

```bash
git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all
```

</details>

Feel free to add a `README.md` file explaining the decisions you've made
solving the tasks including technology and library choices, and instructions
required to run your solution and tests.

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There
is no deadline for this task unless otherwise notified to you directly. You can
also directly send me your bundle by email at remy.tinco'@'getmansa'.com.

> There's something on the task I don't understand

If you have a doubt and can't reach us to clarify it, make the assumption that
feels more natural, document it and move on. We will evaluate based on that
assumption.

> Can I have some extra time to add more features?

Adding extra features is great and we will look at them as well. But the
best thing you can do if you have extra time is to perfect as much as you
can the features that are already required. For example, try adding tests
or more documentation, we will value that more than having a user management
module.

> What if I have a question?

Just create a new issue in this repo and we will get back to you quickly.
You can also send an email directly to remy.tinco'@'getmansa'.com. Asking
questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions.
